object paths /path/to/my/object
object members:
    method
        normal functions, can be invoked, input output etc
    signal
        broadcast message, with (optional) payload

objects have Interfaces (of course)
    specify the methods and signals

proxies
    convenient native object that represents a remote object in another process
    abstracts away the need for explicitly sending and receiving messages

bus names
    spec can define that you own a _name_ which has object at _path_, supporting _interface_
